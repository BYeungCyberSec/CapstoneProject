<h2>Description</h2>
My capstone project is based on NIST CSF and ASD Essential 8 where I explore in depth, about how each framework approaches risk, implementation of security controls and incident response plans. I also explore how NIST CSF differs from ASDE8, as well as the similiarities and how they can be used in tandem to support and improve an organisation's cybersecurity stance.
