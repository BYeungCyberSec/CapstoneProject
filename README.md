<h2>Description</h2> 
My capstone project is based on NIST CSF and ASD Essential 8 where I explore in depth, about how each framework approaches risk, implementation of security controls and incident response plans. I also explore how NIST CSF differs from ASDE8, as well as the similiarities and how they can be used in tandem to support and improve an organisation's cybersecurity stance.



<br> Within this respository, I have included raw text based on my research into ASD8, NIST CSF and also ISO27001 and also a .docx file. I explored and explainedd NIST CSF's core functions, implementation tiers and framework profiles, outlining the steps an organisation should take in order to implement NIST CSF into their cybersecurity stance. I have done the same for ASD8 and ISO27001, outlining security controls and implementation tiers for ASD8 and the development cycle of an ISMS for ISO27001. </br>


I also explore, the advantages in not only saving resources, but increasing cybersecurity for an organisation that two or more of these standards/frameworks, how many areas of cybersecurity are already addressed and additional framework implementation can cover any gaps that the other frameworks may have missed or standards that the industry and or government requires the organisations to implement. </br>
